# Demultiplexing fastq files

Write a command line program to demultiplex a given [gzipped fastq file](data/demultiplex.fastq.gz). 
You can use whatever programming or scripting language youâ€™re comfortable with. 
The fastq file contains [4 samples](data/samples.csv) that were sequenced with different indices:

| **Sample** | **Index** |
|:----------:|:---------:|
|   Sample1  |  CCGCGGTT |
|   Sample2  |  CAAGCTAG |
|   Sample3  |  AGCCTCAT |
|   Sample4  |  TGGATCGA |

For testing purposes, you will find a fastq file with the corresponding samplesheet in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/lmfaber-dkfz/demultiplex
